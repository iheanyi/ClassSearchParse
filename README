DEPENDENCIES:

This program uses the Mechanize (www.search.sourceforge.net/mechanize/) and BeautifulSoup (www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) modules. Both can be obtained by using pip <modulename> or easy_install <modulename>, if you have them installed. 


USAGE:

To run the program, merely run the program like this: python main.py

Classes each have a certain attribute, more information will be included on them later.

In subjects.txt, enter which subjects you would like to search for classes within. Such as: ACCT for account, AME for Aerospace Mechanical Engineering, CSE for Computer Science and Engineering, MGTI for IT Management, etc. You can find these values by doing a Class Search on inside.nd.edu, a link to the list of values will be posted soon.

CHANGELOG:

10/5/2012 - New method of querying classes, there's a public class page that anybody can access so the values are fetched from there, rather than forcing users to enter sensitive information (NetID/Password)

Future Updates:

- Query management from external file, no changing of the source required

- Day of the week handling

- Parse multiple instructors for a course
