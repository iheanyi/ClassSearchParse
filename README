DEPENDENCIES:

This program uses the Mechanize (wwwsearch.sourceforge.net/mechanize/) and BeautifulSoup (www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) modules. Both can be obtained by using pip <modulename> or easy_install <modulename>, if you have them installed. 


USAGE:

To run the program, merely run the program like this: python main.py <Net ID> <password>

In subjects.txt, enter which subjects you would like to search for classes within. Such as: ACCT for account, AME for Aerospace Mechanical Engineering, CSE for Computer Science and Engineering, MGTI for IT Management, etc. You can find these values by doing a Class Search on inside.nd.edu, a link to the list of values will be posted soon.
